# Diffusion Memorization Detector

## Overview
A lightweight Python utility designed to detect **memorization** and **duplication** in datasets generated by diffusion models. 

Instead of pixel-wise comparison, this tool utilizes **Perceptual Hashing (pHash)** to calculate the Hamming Distance between generated samples and training data. This ensures robust detection even when images have undergone resizing, compression, or minor color shifts.

## Key Features
- **Robustness:** Uses pHash (DCT-based) to identify near-duplicates.
- **Batch Processing:** Supports iterating through lists of URLs for efficient testing.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies, CPU-optimized.

## Installation
